# ET Outline Typer
A typing practice application for an evangelism outline.

* Birth of Idea: Long time idea and useful need at my church. 
    * Problems 
        * hard to practice by yourself. How do you know you said the verse verbatum
        * Tedious to check yourself (especially if you type out the whole doc)
        * Only given a paper, have to create note cards to practice
        * After class is over - Binder not around, hard to review

    * Solution - a typing app
        * Notes at the character when you've got an error
        * Easy to do anywhere (mobile friendly)

* Can be hosted on the church website or my own website

## Commands
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:
* `npm start` - Starts the development server.
* `npm run build` - Bundles the app into static files for production.
* `npm test` - Starts the test runner.
* `npm run eject` - Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:
* `cd app`
* `npm start`
